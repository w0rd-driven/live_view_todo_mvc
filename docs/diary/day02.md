# Day 2 - July 13, 2021

Spent a small amount of time trying to work through [In-line the New Item Creation Form](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-todo-list-tutorial#5-in-line-the-new-item-creation-form) but ran into a snag with trying to interpret [Update index/2 in ItemController](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-todo-list-tutorial#52-update-index2-in-itemcontroller) because with LiveView there is no ItemController.

The latest round of commits are today, July 18 which doesn't reflect when I was working on it unfortunately. Doing the diary later isn't the greatest approach but I often do not have time to unpack work before bed time or feeding babies or anything else that takes my focus these days.

I'm looking to take future approaches from [https://dennisbeatty.com/how-to-create-a-todo-list-with-phoenix-liveview.html] as his approach covers less ground for similar results. I am starting to see how all of this fits together now.
