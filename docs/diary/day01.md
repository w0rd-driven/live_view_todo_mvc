# Day 1 - July 11, 2021

This starts out super early because I couldn't sleep. Babies have altered my sleep schedule quite a bit and surprisingly as I write this later the next night, I'm not extremely beat.

I started this process looking at [https://dev.to/amencarini/liveview-todomvc-4jin] but then stumbled on [https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-todo-list-tutorial] that takes a similar approach though I think it doesn't handle LiveView which shouldn't be too hard to adapt.

I am being a little too thorough in the explanations but that'll likely settle down. I suspect as I'm in day 2 now, that I could take way too long on this but I need my brain to be on tasks like this for the moment so it's fine.

There also isn't much learning at this phase though it's mostly been lightweight things like where layouts are, how to surgically remove parts of the page I don't want and just general understanding. The generator for LiveView and really html in general makes this a little too easy. It was also a good idea to build out the example html page to have something clean to compare against.

We end the time with the items entity and scaffolded behavior at [http://localhost:4000/items]
