# Day 6 - July 21, 2021

Started down the rabbit hole of trying to implement [https://github.com/toranb/phoenix-live-view-todomvc/blob/master/lib/todo_web/live/component/todo_item.ex] but failed. I didn't have access to the changeset I wanted nor did I really want to implement that from scratch. The main tutorial had a good approach with [Edit an Item!](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-todo-list-tutorial#8-edit-an-item) so I went with that but gave it a slight spin.

I got to a good stopping point and went with single click behavior as it worked. The end result wasn't exactly what I was looking for but I'm not quite done yet.
